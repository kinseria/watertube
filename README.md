# watertube

### Depercation Notice
I am no longer sending fixes to this site. I see now that the code is poor, the instance is always broken, and other bugs, so within the next few months, a new project will be coming out. The frontend (the website) and backend (video/closed captions fetching) will be seperated into two seperate servers. I'm not shutting the instance down, but I reccomned you stop using it.

### Why I made it?

I created watertube as a YouTube frontend altentive. Basically it's the YouTube client without the tracking (as the server does the fetching for you) and without the ads.

### How do I run it?

Server mode: `npm run`

Desktop mode: `npm run electron-build`
