### Why I made it?

I created watertube as a YouTube frontend altentive. Basically it's the YouTube client without the tracking (as the server does the fetching for you) and without the ads.

### Features
- YouTube Dilikes (provided by the amazing people at https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/)
- No advertisements
- No tracking
- Minimal UI
- Free & Open Source

### How do I run it?

Server mode: `npm run`
Desktop mode: `npm run electron-build`
